      FHIR is a platform specification that defines a set of capabilities for
      use across the healthcare process, in all jurisdictions, and in lots of
      different contexts. While the basics of the FHIR specification are
      relatively straight-forward (see the Overviews: General, Developers,
      Clinical, and Architects), it can still be difficult to know where to
      start when implementing a solution based on FHIR.

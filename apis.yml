      This Section describes the expected capabilities of the US Core Server
      actor which is responsible for providing responses to the queries
      submitted by the US Core Requestors. The complete list of FHIR profiles,
      RESTful operations, and search parameters supported by US Core Servers are
      defined. Systems implementing this capability statement should meet the
      ONC 2015 Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS) access requirement for Patient
      Selection 170.315(g)(7) and Application Access - Data Category Request
      170.315(g)(8) and the ONC [U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)
      Version 4 July
      2023](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/isa/files/2023-07/Final-USCDI-Version-4-July-2023-Final.pdf).

description: >-
  FHIR is a platform specification that defines a set of capabilities for use
  across the healthcare process, in all jurisdictions, and in lots of different
  contexts. While the basics of the FHIR specification are relatively
  straight-forward (see the Overviews: General, Developers, Clinical, and
  Architects), it can still be difficult to know where to start when
  implementing a solution based on FHIR.
